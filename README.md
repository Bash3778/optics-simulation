# optics-simulation
A lens and wave crafter that tries to look at geometric and physical optics. It has many different pieces you would find on an optics bench, or at least the key ones, and a few more advanced pieces.  Its main purpose, howver, is for you to build lens and to then test the lens and see what type of effect they have. This is all a general description though, and there is obviously more than just this.

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t6yapxchevicve6/AABCm7ne7QNoCxS6AbuXMpc9a?dl=0 is the link for the dropbox folder that contains all the assets.  If you open this folder in unity, it should work and give you my progress thus far.  All I have left to do is combine the lens crafter stuff with the optics bench stuff, that measn seeing what the genertated mesh does to light and implementing it on the work bench.

The laser movement and circular polarizer files are just some fun side programs I did. My github skills are not super advanced so forgive the lack of organization or branches that denote the relationship between the different files
