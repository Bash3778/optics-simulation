A lens and wave crafter that tries to look at geometric and physical optics. It has many different pieces you would find on an optics bench, or at least the key ones, and a few more advanced pieces.  Its main purpose, howver, is for you to build lens and to then test the lens and see what type of effect they have. This is all a general description though, and there is obviously more than just this.

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lmubal4iaaijttx/AAAaBXbN8OjPUrDVKf1rpTzna?dl=0 is the link for the dropbox folder that contains all the assets.  If you open this folder in unity, it should work and give you my progress thus far.  All I have left to do is combine the lens crafter stuff with the optics bench stuff, that measn seeing what the genertated mesh does to light and implementing it on the work bench.

The laser movement and circular polarizer files are just some fun side programs I did. My github skills are not super advanced so forgive the lack of organization or branches that denote the relationship between the different files.

The quantum physics and fundementals of optics stuff is the notes I have taken over the summer and extened break.  They should give a good idea of where I am at knowledge wise.  I did not take notes on everything, and I tried to keep my notes focuesed on what was important, so my knowledge range is not limited to my notes. Also keep in mind that the style of my notes changed as well during the break. A link to the book I used for optics is https://www.amazon.com/FUNDAMENTALS-OPTICS-SECOND-Frances-Jenkins/dp/B0000CHS4J and a link to the quantum physics lecture I used is https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2013/lecture-videos/
